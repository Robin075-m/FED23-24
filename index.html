				<h1>About</h1>
			</header>
			<p>I’m bram naus, a digital designer. At least, that’s what I fill in on
				forms. You can also see me as a type nerd, a future entrepreneur, or
				another one of those passionate home cooks. Is it because of an
				imposter syndrome, or my excitement for getting an understanding
				of things? I still don’t know, but I decided to embrace that I love to
				do everything at once - and do it good.</p>
